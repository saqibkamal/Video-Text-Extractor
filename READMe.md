Video-Text-Extractor


A simple python scripts that searches for a given keyword by the user in the video and the frame containing the text is then copied to a
different folder and is displayed to the user.

For searching the text in the video it uses OCR i.e. Optical Character Recognition which is implemented using two different 
functions i.e. first using tesseract library in python which works offline but is less efficinet and the other one is OCR Space
 API which requires proper internet connectivity , it is very efficient but is time consuming.
